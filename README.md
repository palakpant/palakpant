# Hi, I'm Palak 👋

Backend engineer working primarily with Java and Spring Boot.  
I enjoy building secure, scalable systems — especially around authentication, distributed services, and system reliability.

---

## 🚀 What I Work On

- Authentication & authorization systems
- Backend APIs with Spring Boot
- Secure system design (JWT, RBAC, rate limiting)
- Redis caching & performance optimization
- Kafka-based event-driven workflows
- Production debugging & observability

Recently, I’ve been exploring how AI systems can be integrated into backend architectures in a practical way (RAG pipelines, embeddings, API orchestration).
